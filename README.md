Cookie Guard helps site owners comply with the new EU Cookie Law

On May 26th 2012 a new EU directive comes into force requiring website owners to provide clear and comprehensive information to site visitors about cookies used and how they may refuse them.
Site owners will therefore now be obliged to:-
  - tell people that the cookies are there.
  - explain what the cookies are doing.
  - obtain vistorsâ€™ consent to store a cookie on their device.

Cookie Guard lets you list all the known cookies used on your site and offers site visitors the opportunity to block of allow non-essential and unknown cookies.
